This repository contains R scripts used for the analysis of
NanoString transcriptomic data and multiplex imaging data
associated with a human breast tissue aging cohort.

## Repository structure
- analysis/: scripts used to generate figures and statistical analyses
- functions/: custom helper functions
- data/: mock data files illustrating required input formats

## Data availability
Real patient-level NanoString data are publicly available via GEO
(see manuscript for accession number).
Multiplex imaging data are not included due to size and ethical restrictions.

## Running the code
Scripts are written in R (version 4.3+).
Required packages are listed at the top of each script.
